Database Modification Answers

1.	
INSERT INTO Facility ( FacNo, FacName )
VALUES ('F107', 'Swimming Pool');

2.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L107', 'F107', 'Door');

3.	
INSERT INTO Location ( LocNo, FacNo, LocName )
VALUES ('L108', 'F107', 'Locker Room');

4.	
UPDATE Location SET LocName = ÔGateÕ
WHERE LocNo = 'L107'; 

5.
DELETE Location
WHERE LocNo = 'L108';
